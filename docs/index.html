<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In the first section of this project, I learned how to evaluate Bezier curves and surfaces. In the second section of this project I learned how to implement multiple operations on a triangle mesh, including edge flipping, edge splitting, and upsampling using loop division. I found the builing-up of this project very interesting, such as how we grew from rendering Bezier curves to whole surfaces and objects, and then using edge flipping and splitting together to increase the resolution of renders and make what were once blocky individual surface flat renders look smooth.
</p>
<br>


<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

<p>
  De Casteljau's algorithm is an algorithm to generate Bezier curves by taking the control points of the Bezier curve and interpolating intermediate points, then using those intermediate points to recursively interpolate further intermediate points until one recursive layer only has one point left, at which that point will be along the Bezier curve. 
  <br><br>
  In this part, we implemented de Casteljau's algorithm recursively by implementing a evaluateStep, which runs single step of the interpolation with $n$ input points and a proportional parameter $t$ such that the linearly interpolated point is (point 1)$*t$ + (point 2)*$(1-t)$. Each step returns the $n-1$ interpolated points, and this is recursively run until we have one point in the output.
</p>

<p>
  Here is an example set of 6 control points we will use to generate our Bezier curve.
  <br><br>
</p>
<div align="middle">

</div>
<br>

<p>
  In the images below, we can see each step of the points interpolated by de Casteljau's algorithm from the original control points all the way down to the final evaluated point, and we can see that the final point is on the curve.

  We can also observe how changing the control points slightly and changing the parameter $t$ changes the curve.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<p>
    In this part, we extend our notion of Bezier curves one dimension up, to Bezier surfaces. If we have an $n \times n$ grid of control points, we can perform the 1D version of de Casteljau's algorithm with parameter $u$ on each row of control points to obtain a set of final interpolated points, one per row. We can then treat this set of interpolated points as another set of control points, and apply another 1D de Casteljau's algorithm with parameter $v$ to those control points to interpolate a final point that will lie on the Bezier surface. Taking all the points interpolated for all the parameters $u$ and $v$ gives us the Bezier surface.
    <br><br>
    We implemented this algorithm using three methods:
    <ul>
      <li>evaluateStep runs one step of de Casteljau's algorithm with parameter $t$, similar to the previous part, but on 3D points this time</li>
      <li>evaluate1D runs evaluateStep until only one point remains in the interpolated set</li>
      <li>evaluate takes the original set of control points and parameters $u$ and $v$ and runs the full algorithm, with the first layer using $u$ as $t$ and the second layer using $v$ as $t$</li>
    </ul>

</p>

<p>
    Shown below is a teapot rendered by this algorithm. You can see the individual surfaces rendered:

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<p>
    In this part, we implemented area-weighted normal vectors at vertices. We can use these vertex normals for Phong shading, which will allow the surface to look smoother than if we just used flat shading. To compute the area-weighted normal vector for a given vector, I iterated over all of the faces with that vertex as one of its vertices. For each face, I computed its area by taking its 3 vertices $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$ and calculating $\frac{1}{2}$ times the norm of the cross product edge vectors $v_3-v_1$ and $v_2-v_1$. I summed the normal vector * the area across of all the incident faces, then normalized the resulting vector to find the final area-weighted normal vector for that vertex. 
</p>

<p>
  Shown below is a comparison between the teapot rendered with flat shading and the teapot rendered with Phong shading using our newly implemented area-weighted normal vectors. We can observe the distinct edge lines that are present in flat shading, but these artifacts go away when using smooth shading.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    In this part, we implemented the edge flip operation. An edge flip on the shared edge of two triangles flips edge to the other diagonal of the quadrilateral formed by the two triangles. In my implementation, I retrieved the two faces, four vertices, and six halfedges that made up the two triangles. I then used setNeighbors to reassign the pointers according to how they would be arranged if the edge were flipped. 
    <br><br>
    Shown below is the teapot, and the teapot with the edges within the middle surfaces flipped.
</p>
<br>

    <br>
  </table>
</div>

<br>
<p>
  Before I wrote up my implementation, I wrote out what the correspondance change should be, so the implementation went smoothly. However, I did get some of the correspondances wrong, so that took some trial-and-correction before I finally had the correct arrangement.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    In this part, we implemented edge splitting, which inserts a vertex at the midpoint of a shared edge between two triangles and connects all vertices of the two triangles to that vertex, thereby splitting 2 faces into 4. In my implementation, I retrieved the two faces, four vertices, and six halfedges that made up the two triangles. In addition, I created the middle vertex and set its position to halfway between the vertices of our original edges, and any new halfedges and faces we would need after our edge split. I then used setNeighbors to reassign the pointers according to how they would be arranged in the new arrangement.
    <br><br>
    Shown below is the teapot, the teapot with the middle edges split to form a star pattern, and the teapot with a more intricate star pattern created using a combination of edge flips and splits.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<p>
    In this part we implemented loop subdivision, which upsamples a polygon mesh into a higher resolution one by 
    <ol>
      <li>subdividing each of its triangles into four smaller triangles by connecting each pair of edge midpoints</li>
      <li>updating vertex positions as a weighted average of neighboring vertex positions, such that for a shared edge $(A,B)$ between a pair of triangles $(A,C,B)$ and $(A,B,D)$, the position of the new vertex is $\frac{3}{8}*(A+B)+\frac{1}{8}*(C+D)$, and the updated position of an old vertex is $(1-n*u)*\text{(original position)} + u * \text{(original neighbor position sum)}$, where $n$ is the number of edges incident to the vertex, and $u = \frac{3}{16}$ if $n=3$, and $\frac{3}{8n}$ otherwise.</li>
    </ol>
    I followed the guided implementation given, which broke down the implementation into 5 steps:
    <ol>
      <li>Compute new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh, using the Loop subdivision rule, and store them vertex's new position. At this point, we also want to mark each vertex as being a vertex of the original mesh using the isNew flag.</li>
      <li>Compute the updated vertex positions associated with edges, and store it in the edge's new position.</li>
      <li>Split every edge in the mesh, in any order. We assign the isNew flag accordingly for edges as well to avoid splitting edges that we just split.</li>
      <li>Flip any new edge that connects an old and new vertex.</li>
      <li>Copy vertex's new position into vertex's position for all vertices.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<br>


<p>
    Shown below are some images of loop subdivision. I chose to use the teapot and the cow because they had the least mesh elements and lagged the least when upsampling multiple times, while still being more than a basic shape.

<p>
  We notice that the meshes get slightly smaller and smoother as the sharp corners and edges are rounded. This effect is very obvious with the render of the cube, shown below.
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr align="center">
      <td>
        <img src="images/cube_level_1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>

        <figcaption>Cube upsampled twice</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
  </table>
</div>
<p>
  However, we can reduce this effect and preserve some of the sharpness by splitting the edges around the corners.
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr align="center">
      <td>
        <img src="images/sharp_cube_level_1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption>Original Cube, pre-split to preserve sharpness</figcaption>

      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
  </table>
</div>
<br>

<p>
    We also notice that the original cube upsampling was asymmetric. This is because the edges acrosses the faces only encompass one of the diagonals of the face, so the faces are asymmetric with respect to the edges. By splitting the face in such a way that it is 4-way symmetric, it preserves its symmetry across its 4 edges per face. The above example shows this, as well as an even simpler pre-split shown below.
